## Moodle Code Activity ##

Eventually, the goal for this project is to have a built in Java and Python IDE that you can use as a Moodle activity with your students. They'll login and work on labs and the activity will grade their code based on tests that you create; either output matching or unit tests.

For now, it doesn't do much. So, don't download it. 

I lost about 2 days of work when I clicked the wrong button in Moodle and the activity project was deleted. So, for now, it's on GitHub as a backup in case I do something stupid again.
